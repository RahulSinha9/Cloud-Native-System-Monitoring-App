# Cloud-Native-System-Monitoring-App
 I developed a Flask-based system monitoring application, containerized it with Docker, and orchestrated deployment on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) within the AWS Cloud environment.


(Things to have before starting the projects)

 AWS Account.
 Programmatic access and AWS configured with CLI.
 Python3 Installed.
 Docker and Kubectl installed.
 Code editor (Vscode)

 Part 1: Deploying the Flask application locally.

 Part 2: Dockerizing the Flask application.

 Part 3: Pushing the Docker image to ECR.

 Part 4: Creating an EKS cluster and deploying the app using Python.
